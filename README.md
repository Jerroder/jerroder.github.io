# Privacy Policy for Remote Lens:

Remote Lens allows to control a Canon camera via Bluetooth. It runs entirely locally, on your iOS device. It does not need a network connection.

Remote Lens does not collect any data, period.

You can use Remote Lens to take photos, navigate photos taken and add GPS tags to your photos. All of this will happen between your device and your camera.

I do not have any way to access the data created by the user.
